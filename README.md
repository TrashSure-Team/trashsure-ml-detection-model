# TrashSure ML Detection Model

## Description
Welcome to the TrashSure ML Detection Model repository! This repository contains a deep learning model that has been trained to perform the task of detecting various waste types.

The main goal of this project is to assist in the automated detection of waste items into specific categories. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, we aim to contribute to environmental sustainability and waste management efforts.

## Pre-Requisites

Before using this classification model, please ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Python**: You must install Python, preferably version 3.8 or later.

2. **Python Packages**: The necessary Python packages for running the model are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install these packages using `pip` as shown below.


## Installation

To get started with the TrashSure ML Detection Model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local device using `git`:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TrashSure-Team/trashsure-ml-detection-model.git

2. Change your current directory to the repository:

   ```
   cd trashsure-ml-detection-model
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Testing

If you want to see our model in action with pre-annotated Trash images, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you fulfill all the requirements mentioned in the `requirements.txt` 

2. Run this command to <b>Download</b> the TACO dataset images (This may take a while):

    ```
    python download.py
    ```

3. Go to the `detector` directory:

    ```
    cd test
    ```
4. Run the `test.py` model using this command:

    ```
    python test.py test --dataset=../data --model=models --round 0 --class_map=./dataset_configurations/map.csv
    ```
